This is a web app **web** that is build with express server, VUE JS as the frond-end and MySQL database.

The purpose of the app is to allow the owner of the  Question & answer site manage his questionnaires. It allow the admin user to add new question, edit, and delete them and also add answers as he wish to a specific question. The app allow people to register in to the system and attempt question by voting for a particular option. Upon their completion of voting  their score would be displayed on another page.They have the chance to also **retake** the test again. As for the admin he or she has a seperate route to register : "/registeradmin" this route is hidden and only known to te admin

## HOW TO USE IT

First you have to have NODEJS installed on your PC.

Then open the client site in the terminal and run: **npm run serve** OR **yarn run serve** and for the server run **npm run start** OR **yarn run serve**
